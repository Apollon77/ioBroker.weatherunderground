What about backward compatibility? Should in settings the last two checkboxes be active by default ?! Or do you have "if undefined" handling in there?
I see that in io-package it is set to true, but admin did not showed it (i upgraded from npm version to github version using admin). Thank you for checking it

And when chaning only checkboxes the "save" buttons in Admin do not get activated. Can you please check that too?!
